<p>Rainbow Notes is an application built during the semester of Spring 2022, in the ICS-314 course for Software Development.</p>

<p>Our organization can be viewed on the <a href="https://rainbow-notes.github.io/">Rainbow Notes</a> website.</p>

<p>Our application exercised the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meteor for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.</li>
  <li>React for component-based UI implementation and routing.</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap CSS Framework for UI design.</li>
  <li>Uniforms for React based form design and display.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>At the tail end of our course, we were given an option to work on a final application from a given list generic application ideas. While those <a href="https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f22/modules/final-project/">project ideas</a> were interesting, one of our group members came up with an interesting idea for a note sharing application that would be serve our need for study and review purposes in our undergraduate pursuit while being <em>ethical</em>. Our result was Rainbow-Notes. We took common ideas like a rating component such as the stars for Amazon projects or Chegg’s up or down rating, and a shared database to enable University wide note sharing.</p>

<h2 id="my-contributions-and-future-iterations">My Contributions and Future Iterations</h2>
<p>For this project, my group worked hard to distribute work equally given our individual strengths and weaknesses. My primary contributions were in agile project management, creating issues, and testing the application for contiguous integration. All of which I learned during this whole process. I highly enjoyed splitting up work on a project based timeframe using GitHubs projects and seeing the issues being completed. As well as being able to go to others for assistance. 
<br />
<br />
I also liked learning TestCafe for end-to-end testing of our application, ensuring that all of our web components were working well and in order. I also had my hand in solving what Mongo collections we would need and creating the Landing and Sign out page. Our whole team had a hand in the layout, UI, and overall direction we wanted to go with our app. While we had big plans to incorporate a forum and other popular features, we had to settle with minimal functionality like an administrative functionality, rating components, and simple database manipulation such as adding and removing courses, notes, ratings, and profiles. Despite it’s simplicity, I am proud of how much my team was able to accomplish in such a short period of time and how much we’ve learned over the span of the project. Rainbow-Notes is one of my favorite projects this semester, by far. I can see myself taking time to working on it, testing out new features and concepts of software engineering that I’ll learn over time.</p>
