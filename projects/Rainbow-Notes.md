## Rainbow-Notes
Rainbow Notes is an application built during the semester of Spring 2022, in the ICS-314 course for Software Development.

Our organization can be viewed on the <a href="https://rainbow-notes.github.io/">Rainbow Notes</a> website.

Our application exercises the following features.
<ul>
  <li>Meteor for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.</li>
  <li>React for component-based UI implementation and routing.</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap CSS Framework for UI design.</li>
  <li>Uniforms for React based form design and display.</li>
</ul>

## My Contributions and Learning
For this project, my primary contributions were in agile project management, creating issues, and testing the application for contiguous integration. All of which I learned during this whole process. I highly enjoyed splitting up work on a project based timeframe using GitHubs projects and seeing the trends issues being completed. As well as being able to go to others for assistance. I also liked learning TestCafe for end-to-end testing of our application, ensuring that all of our web components were working well and in order.
