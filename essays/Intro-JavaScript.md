*A new frontier: My start with JavaScript*

During the time of writing this essay, it has already been a whole week since the beginning of the semester. The beginning of the end of my undergraduate education in Computer Engineering at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa; I graduate this Fall. Although, I’m nearing the end of this journey and I have been introduced to a multitude of concepts and tools related to my career path, I’m ashamed to say that I haven’t learned a thing about programming languages that interface with the web, such as JavaScript. 

Regardless of the circumstance, I am eager to get started.

## Where I'm at
 I wouldn’t say that I am an expert just yet in any programming language, but through my current curriculum, I am familiar with C and some C++. Through summer internships and self teaching, I’ve also learned basic python and BASH scripting as well so seeing pieces of JavaScript code didn’t seem alien. My initial thoughts on JavaScript are “This seems familiar”. 

## My Experience 
 Using freecodecamp’s JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures certification course, I was able to see similarities in the basic syntax of languages I’ve learned. JavaScripts basic function formation and statement ending semicolons matched that of C and C++. It's simple declaration of variables, objects, and shortcuts reminded me of that of pythons. That was the first couple of exercises in the course. Once I went past the halfway point I noticed that I would need to spend more time with some concepts compared to others that I’m already familiar with. The parts that were foreign to me were its uses of another programming language within it such as HTML. It will also take time getting familiar with and utilizing built in functions that I haven’t experienced until now.

## Course Layout and Final Thoughts 
In regards to Athletic Software Engineering and WODs or workouts of the day,I have a feeling that this will be one of the more useful components of this class when it comes to learning the material. Being able to think quickly and apply the knowledge is a big part of learning. While I’ve only experienced the practice problem, I believe the time constraints will be very beneficial in the long run(despite the possible negative short term effects against my grades).
