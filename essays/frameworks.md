### The User Interface

  User Interfaces (UI) are an important medium between users and computers and their applications to the world wide web. They have evolved exponentially over the years. Since the release of Apple Macintosh's Graphical User Interface (GUI) Computer in 1984, they have become a staple in every computing device. As computer useage has grown, so too has the importance of User Interfaces for the applications and websites we access day to day. Over 4.9 billion or 62% of the world's population use the internet, and that demand has allowed for expansion of various development tools such as web frameworks. Frameworks are extremely good taking standard UI development practices such as creating and using navigation bars and footer, or handling spacing between different elements, and creating developer friendly application programming interfaces.

### My thoughts

  Out of that long list of common practices, it appears I have surprisingly been practicing a small fraction of them all along, yet I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to implementing coding standards in my own work. Understanding this earlier in my coding career would have been of great help when it came to working on group programming projects. Not only did it make it slightly more challenging trying to decipher my group mates work, with all of our different personal standards, but our work always seemed to be missing a sense of uniformity and professionalism that I would see in popular and well managed repositories. While it did seem like extra work before, being introduced to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and plugin code editors like <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> has left me with feeling like most the the work is done for me. Now, I can focus on solving problems and rely on those tools to keep my code neat and uniform within a set of standards.

### Now what?
Although coding standards change based on the people, companies, or projects you work on, it is best to get used to them. At the very least, being able to understand them and to apply them into your code at any given moment. Like moving to a different country, it would behoove you to adopt their customs, courtesies, and language. To be able to communicate effectively, to understand others and to be understood is the most important factor when it comes to your success a programming environment.

For me, I will continue to do my best to add some of those standards in my everyday coding and stay open and flexible to applying new ones to assimilate to my current coding environment. With the plethora of tools available to us, what do we have to lose?
