*Getting to know frameworks*
### The User Interface

  User Interfaces (UI) are an important medium between users and computers and their applications to the world wide web. They have evolved exponentially over the years. Since the release of Apple Macintosh's Graphical User Interface (GUI) Computer in 1984, they have become a staple in every computing device. As computer useage has grown, so too has the importance of User Interfaces for the applications and websites we access day to day. Over 4.9 billion or 62% of the world's population use the internet, and that demand has allowed for expansion of various development tools such as web frameworks. 
  Frameworks are extremely good taking standard UI development practices such as creating and utilizing containers, handling spacing between different elements, or styling a web page, and creating well-organized and responsive shortcuts to fit the developers needs.  
  The only caviat is that these frameworks are often extensive and have a learning curve. Using cascading style sheets (CSS) and hyper-text markup languag (HTML) are common place staples in web development so why do we bother using them?

### Pros and Cons

  We can treat web development like a roadmap. Before starting our trip, we need to take into account of all the paths we can take and which one will lead us to our destination in the most efficient way possible. When weighing out the different options on whether to use a framework or not you should ask yourself:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5>What are you trying to accomplish?</h5>
      <p>test</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Who are you sharing this code with?</h5>
      <p>test</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Will using a framework make this project more efficient?</h5>
      <p>test</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
