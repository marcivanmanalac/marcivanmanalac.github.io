## Overview
*The Problem*: When they struggle with a class, many students ask for help or notes from those who previously took that course. There is no effective method for them to seek help unless they know someone directly.

*The Solution*: Chegg v2 (to be renamed) is an app for students to meet with other students who previously took a course. These students can also post their old notes which will forma  community where students can be helped in the future.

## Mockup Page Ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:
<ul>
  <li>Landing page</li>
  <li>User home page</li>
  <li>Admin home page</li>
  <li>User profile page</li>
</ul>

## Use Case Ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, requests study sesh.
User is notified of study sesh, responds. (Can they respond via text message?)
User checks their status with respect to game mechanics.


## Beyond the Basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
Text message interface. See notifications, and reply to confirm attendance all through text message.
Slack integration to facilitate notification and organization of meetings.
A Slack Bot to suggest and help implement Study Buddy meetings.
A rating system for meetings and sensei participation.
