*One step for student, one giant leap for developer.*
### I realized, I know nothing.

  Once again, I am humbled by how little I actually know about a topic. This time, it is regarding software development. Coming into this course, I thought I watched enough Youtube videos titled, *Learn software dev in 60 seconds*, to know what software development is. A bit of HTML videos here and some CSS tutorials there, but through this semester, I've learned its much more than creating a fancy user interface or having the ability to talk about the newest programming language. 
    <br>
    In the following sections I will be discussing fundamental concepts or pillars of software development that I've learned over the past four months.

### Development Environments

### Coding Standards

### User Interface Frameworks

### Agile Project Management

### Design Patterns

### Ethics in Software Engineering

### Onward
Although coding standards change based on the people, companies, or projects you work on, it is best to get used to them. At the very least, being able to understand them and to apply them into your code at any given moment. Like moving to a different country, it would behoove you to adopt their customs, courtesies, and language. To be able to communicate effectively, to understand others and to be understood is the most important factor when it comes to your success a programming environment.

For me, I will continue to do my best to add some of those standards in my everyday coding and stay open and flexible to applying new ones to assimilate to my current coding environment. With the plethora of tools available to us, what do we have to lose?
