  Despite experiencing numerous assignment, programs, projects, and essays during my time in university, it never fails to surprise me how I can make completing my work more difficult than it should be. I sometimes have a tendency to start writing a paper from top to bottom, even if there are sections below I can complete quicker or write computer programs without thinking of an algorithm first. These are all examples of me failing to utilize study and work patterns that have kept me successful in turning in quality work. Things such as getting enough rest, taking proper notes, eating a healthy diet and exercising also play an important role in my efficiency. Similarly, in the world of computers, we can utilize tried and proven design patterns that prevent us from "Reinventing the wheel" everytime we work on a problem. In the next few sections we will discuss some of these design patterns in detail.

<h3 id="common-design-patterns">Common Design Patterns</h3>
<p>The term Design Patterns was defined in 1977 by an architect of the name Christopher Alexander in his book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language">A Pattern Language<a></a>. He described it <em>as a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.</em> This definition was profound in that despite having a new problem, though not necessarily identical to an old one you’ve encountered, the older solutions can be used to as a template or guide to how tackling the problem can be structured. A simple example would be the type of roofs built in an environment such as Alaska. Although weather can vary geographically, common sense and experience would tell us that flat roofs would not do well in a snowy environment where pointy roofs are much more reasonable against the weather.</a></p>

<p>In terms of software design, A group of software developers, inspired by Christopher Alexander’s views on design patterns, published a <a href="">book</a> on software development patterns. They would later be famously dubbed as the <em>Gang of Four</em>. The 23 patterns the authors/developers identified could be broken into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Like the the roofs in Alaska, we can identify patterns in our programming objective that can help us find the right solution.</p>

    <li>
      <h5>Creational</h5>
      <p>
        Provides different ways to create an object.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Structural</h5>
      <p>
        Provides relationships between objects.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Behavioral</h5>
      <p>
        Provides how objects interact or communicate with one another.

<p>Above are the types of design patterns for object oriented programming and their definition. Below is a table of the Patterns defined by the Gang of Four and summarized in an <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/gang-of-four-design-patterns-8c85a80eac0a">blog post</a> by Ela Singh.</p>

<h3 id="putting-patterns-to-practice">Putting Patterns to Practice</h3>
<p>At a glance, I did not think I was familiar with any of the design patterns listed by the Authors. After all, my experience with object oriented programming is rather short for a computer engineering student. However, after closer inspection, I was surprised to find I counted myself out too early. In terms of Creational design, I recall creating a program which utilized a factory pattern for creating various animals for an <em>animal farm</em>. It makes sense that we used a factory method rather than creating each object by hand. However, it was difficult for me to grasp that concept and is still not completely clear to me. For Structural patterns, I have yet to use or come across this pattern, but I can see it being very helpful. Lastly, Behavioral. During this software development course, I was introduced to handling events, subscribers, and publishers for meteor collections which are directly related to Observer patterns.</p>

<h3 id="more-patterns-and-beyond">More Patterns and Beyond</h3>
<p>Besides the 23 patterns listed above, there are more patterns that have been useful to specific languages such as Javascript as listed in the the <a href="https://patterns.dev">Patterns.dev<a></a> site. While older patterns such as flyweight, proxy, and command are still often seen and used, we see the emergence of newer patterns such as hooks introduced in the react library for reusing stateful logic, tree shaking for reducing bundle size by eliminating dead code, progressive hydration to delay loading of less important parts of pages and much more. I have no doubt that as I continue to code and grow as a developer, I will come to know and rely on these patterns more than not as I do with all patterns in my life. As the theoretical physicist Fritjof Capra one said, <em>The understanding of life begins with the understanding of patterns</em>.</a></p>
