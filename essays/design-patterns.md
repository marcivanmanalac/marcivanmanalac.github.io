*Why it matters*
### Design Project Mayhem

  Despite experiencing numerous assignment, programs, projects, and essays during my time in university, it never fails to surprise me how I can make completing my work more difficult than it should be. I sometimes have a tendency to start writing a paper from top to bottom, even if there are sections below I can complete quicker or write computer programs without thinking of an algorithm first. These are all examples of me failing to utilize study and work patterns that have kept me successful in turning in quality work. Things such as getting enough rest, taking proper notes, eating a healthy diet and exercising also play an important role in my efficiency. Similarly, in the world of computers, we can utilize tried and proven design patterns that prevent us from "Reinventing the wheel" everytime we work on a problem. In the next few sections we will discuss some of these design patterns in detail.

### Common Design Patterns
  The term Design Patterns was defined in 1977 by an architect of the name Christopher Alexander in his book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language">A Pattern Language<a/>. He described it *as a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.* This definition was profound in that despite having a new problem, though not necessarily identical to an old one you've encountered, the older solutions can be used to as a template or guide to how tackling the problem can be structured. A simple example would be the type of roofs built in an environment such as Alaska. Although weather can vary geographically, common sense and experience would tell us that flat roofs would not do well in a snowy environment where pointy roofs are much more reasonable against the weather.

  In terms of software design, A group of software developers, inspired by Christopher Alexander's views on design patterns, published a <a href="">book</a> on software development patterns. They would later be famously dubbed as the *Gang of Four*. The 23 patterns the authors/developers identified could be broken into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Like the the roofs in Alaska, we can identify patterns in our programming objective that can help us find the right solution.

    <li>
      <h5>Creational</h5>
      <p>
        Provides different ways to create an object.

    <li>
      <h5>Structural</h5>
      <p>
        Provides relationships between objects.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Behavioral</h5>
      <p>
        Provides how objects interact or communicate with one another.

<p>Above are the types of design patterns for object oriented programming and their definition. Below is a table of the Patterns defined by the Gang of Four and summarized in an <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/gang-of-four-design-patterns-8c85a80eac0a">blog post</a> by Ela Singh.</p>
