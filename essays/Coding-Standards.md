*Why it matters if others can understand your code*
### Who Cares if others can't read your code?

  It has been a little over two years since writing my first line of code. That accelerated summer course in C programming was both enlightening and  frustrating. At the time, I didn't think about how my code was written or how legible it was; my only priority was to get the bloody program to work. It was only when a teachers assistant brought it to my attention that she couldn't give me partial points for my work due to its illegibility that knew I needed to change something. From then on I tried replicating professor and TAs style of writing. I made indents within a coding block, gave my brackets their own spaces, and wrote comments after a statement just to name a few changes. Most importantly, I gave my programs structure which enabled those who were grading my work the ability to see my methods and thought process for my approach in solving problems. Once that class was over I kept the same format for all programming related work. I didn't think there was an actual way of writing code that is widely recognized by many; a *coding standard*. Until now. Why is this important to me and why should I care?

 There are many definitions for the term *Coding Standards*. In summary, It is a way for programmers to work together and understand code; a sort of language for understanding the language for any given project.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/">GeeksForGeeks</a> explains the need for coding standards and a handful of purposes for having them.
  <ul>
    <li>A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.</li>   
    <li>It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.</li>
    <li>It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.</li>
    <li>It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.</li>
  </ul>
These are some of the common standards practiced in the programming community:
  <ul>
    <li>Limited use of globals</li>
    <li>Standard headers for different modules</li>
    <li>Naming conventions for local variables, global variables, constants and functions</li>
    <li>Indentation</li>
    <li>Error return values and exception handling conventions</li>
    <li>Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand</li>
    <li>Avoid using an identifier for multiple purposes</li>
    <li>Code should be well documented</li>
    <li>Length of functions should not be very large</li>
    <li>Try not to use GOTO statement</li>
  </ul>

### Personal Experience With Standards

### Now what?
Phasellus ut fringilla nisi. Sed sed tellus convallis, finibus ligula vel, imperdiet eros. Aliquam erat volutpat. Integer in mollis nibh, id ornare lacus. Suspendisse turpis mi, vehicula eget mattis nec, fringilla quis nisi. Duis risus nisi, molestie vitae ipsum sed, lobortis varius elit. Mauris lobortis sem quis libero vulputate accumsan. Nunc facilisis quam et neque feugiat, ut rhoncus est pretium.

Vivamus vitae rutrum libero. Curabitur in magna sollicitudin tortor egestas lobortis. Nulla tempus turpis mi, et sagittis urna scelerisque vitae. Aliquam accumsan metus et nunc fermentum pellentesque. Pellentesque rutrum metus in velit elementum, vel bibendum ante mollis. Mauris in scelerisque ipsum, vitae lobortis lectus. Duis eget commodo eros. Nullam laoreet tellus vel turpis vestibulum bibendum. Duis ornare dapibus cursus. Nulla ac ex in ante aliquam aliquam. Quisque scelerisque, felis nec rutrum tincidunt, magna enim tristique nunc, sed rutrum diam magna nec odio. Fusce porttitor quam nec orci malesuada, ut tempor tortor tempor.
