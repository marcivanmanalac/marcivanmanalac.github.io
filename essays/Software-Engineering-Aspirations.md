*Interest in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences I hope to develop in the future*

<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/softeng/softeng.jpg">
My interests in software engineering have slowly developed in the past couple of years. Early on, I was intimidated by the plethora of languages, tools, and resources that were out there. In my freshmen year, I would do the typical student thing and Youtube "What skills do I need as a Software Engineer"? YouTube was littered with videos stating, "Here's why you should learn these ten tools" or "The only software engineering tools you need" or my personal favorite "Why I quit Software Engineering. 

With everyone contradicting one another it was hard to find a language to consider dedicating some time into learning.

## Looking Back
ICS 314 is one of those courses I wish I took earlier on. In hindsight, it would have been handy to have a better understanding of all the tools used in this course. Certain courses early on required a lot of collaboration with group members for software related work. Working with others wasn't too much of a problem for me. What made it much more difficult was the ongoing COVID pandemic which shifted all learning and group work online. Having a better understanding of git and it's version control resources would have made life much easier.

## Hopes for the future
I chose to study computer engineering because I want the fleibility of being able to work in hardware or software computer related roles. With this in mind, I would like to continue to maintain and develop this Professional Portfolio to showcase my achievements and aspirations for future. I would also like to sharpen my skills in regards to Software Engineering as a whole; being able to work with a minimal tech stack.
